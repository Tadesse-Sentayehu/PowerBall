 How does the Powerball game work in this assignment?

 •The Power ball game in this assignment works differently from the real one 
 like Mega Millions to get more chances to get favorite results. 

 •The Powerball game includes two parts. 

 •Part one includes 5 numbers. These five numbers are white ball numbers,
 which are drawn randomly from 20 numbers from 1 to 20 
 inclusively-(1,2,3, 4, 5,... , 17,18,19, 20).

 •Part two only has one number, the Powerball number, 
 which is obtained randomly from 10 numbers(1,2,3,4, 5,6,7,8, 9,10).

 •When the program/page is run or reloaded/refreshed, it would display:-
 Today’s Powerball winning numbers, your lucky numbers,
 and display the result based on your :-
 lucky numbers against Today’s Powerball winning numbers. 
 Here is one of the examples when the code run. 

           The result will display like this
            from the Jackpot to the list
